# FIFA 23 Player Performance & Potential Analysis (Tableau)

An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing FIFA 23 player data to evaluate performance, growth potential, wages, and market value. This project demonstrates analytical thinking, data storytelling, and dashboard design for decision-making use cases such as scouting, player valuation, and team benchmarking.



Project Overview

This project focuses on transforming raw FIFA 23 player data into an **insight-driven Tableau dashboard**.  
The objective is to help stakeholders identify emerging talent, assess player value relative to performance, and compare clubs and countries based on player quality.

The dashboard emphasizes **clarity, interactivity, and business relevance**, enabling users to explore patterns and answer targeted questions without technical overhead.


Business Context

In modern football analytics, clubs and analysts must balance:
- Player performance vs future potential  
- Wage efficiency and market value  
- Talent development across clubs and regions  

This dashboard simulates a **scouting and performance analysis tool**, allowing users to quickly surface insights that support recruitment and valuation decisions.

Tools & Technologies

- Tableau Desktop  
- FIFA 23 player dataset  
- Calculated fields and parameters  
- Interactive filters and dashboards  

 Key Metrics

High-level KPIs provide immediate context:

- **Average Overall Rating:** 66  
- **Average Potential Rating:** 71  
- **Average Market Value:** €3M  

These metrics help frame the distribution of talent across the dataset.


Dashboard Components

Interactive Filters
Users can segment the data by:
- Country  
- Club  
- Player name  

This enables targeted analysis for specific teams, leagues, or individuals.


Clubs Crushing It
A bar chart highlighting clubs and countries with the **highest average overall ratings**, useful for:
- Benchmarking talent quality  
- Identifying strong development ecosystems  



Who’s Ready to Shine Next?
A scatter plot comparing **current rating vs potential rating**, designed to:
- Identify players with high upside  
- Highlight emerging talent before peak performance  



Players’ Wages vs Overall Rating
This view examines the relationship between **wages and performance**, helping to:
- Identify underpaid high performers  
- Detect wage inefficiencies  
- Understand compensation trends across players  



Rising Stars: Market Value & Potential
A bubble chart visualizing:
- Market value (bubble size)  
- Player potential (positioning)  

This supports quick identification of players combining **high potential with strong or growing market value**.



Results & Key Takeaways

- Clear separation emerges between **current performance and future potential**, enabling early identification of rising stars  
- Several players show **high potential but relatively low market value**, indicating possible undervaluation  
- Wage distribution does not scale linearly with performance, highlighting **inefficiencies in player compensation**  
- Certain clubs and countries consistently rank higher in average ratings, suggesting stronger talent pipelines  
- Interactive filtering significantly improves insight discovery compared to static reporting  

Overall, the dashboard demonstrates how **visual analytics can support scouting, recruitment, and valuation decisions**.
